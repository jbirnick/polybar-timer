# polybar-timer

This script implements a **simple** and **customizable** timer for your bar.

- specify command to execute when timer expires (e.g. notify-send, shell script, ...)
- interactive:
  * e.g. scroll to increase / decrease timer
  * click to start predefined timers
  * while changing a timer a notification displays when the timer will expire
- different icons for different kind of timers

![screenshot set timer](screenshots/setTimer.gif) (set a timer)

![screenshot cancel timer](screenshots/cancelTimer.gif) (cancel a timer)

![screenshot set predefined timer](screenshots/predefinedTimer.gif) (start predefined timer)

![screenshot set predefined timer 2 and increase it](screenshots/predefinedTimer2.gif) (start other predefined timer and increase it)

![screenshot see expiry time](screenshots/expiryTimePreview.gif) (watch expiry time when you change a timer)

Even though the repo is named [`polybar-timer`](#), it is a general script and you can use it for every bar.
You can **customize behaviour and appearance in a simple way**.

An example use case would be a pomodoro timer and/or self-reminders when next meeting begins.

## Dependencies

Inside the script `dunstify` is called to view the mentioned notification for the expiry time.
But this is not necessary. (Just beautiful.) If you do not use Dunst than still everything (but the preview of the expiry time) **will work fine without dependencies**.

## Installation

1. Download [polybar-timer.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbirnick/polybar-timer/master/polybar-timer.sh) from this repo.
2. Make it executable. (`chmod +x polybar-timer.sh`)
3. Copy-paste the [example configuration](#example-configuration) from below into you polybar config.
4. Customize. (see [Customization section](#customization))

## Example Configuration

```ini
[module/timer]

type = custom/script

exec = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh tail 'TIMER' 5
tail = true

click-left = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh new 25 'Pomo session' 'notify-send "Session finished"' ; /path/to/polybar-timer.sh update %pid%
click-middle = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh cancel ; /path/to/polybar-timer.sh update %pid%
click-right = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh new 5 'Pomo break' 'notify-send "Break finished"' ; /path/to/polybar-timer.sh update %pid%
scroll-up = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh increase 60 || /path/to/polybar-timer.sh new 1 'TIMER:' 'notify-send -u critical "Timer expired."' ; /path/to/polybar-timer.sh update %pid%
scroll-down = /path/to/polybar-timer.sh increase -60 ; /path/to/polybar-timer.sh update %pid%
```

## Customization

The example configuration implements a 25min "pomodoro session" timer with left click, a 5min
"pomodoro break" timer with right click and a normal timer by just scrolling up
from the standby mode.

You can customize the different strings, numbers and actions to your own flavor and needs. To understand what the commands do and to implement some different behaviour see the [documentation](#documentation).

If you want to do some really specific stuff and add some functionality, just edit the script. It is really simple. Just take your 10 minutes to understand what it does and then customize it.

## Documentation

Notation: `<...>` are necessary arguments and `[...=DEFAULTVALUE]` are optional
and if you do not specify them their `DEFAULTVALUE` is used.

If want to understand or edit the script I highly recommend to run a tail process
in a terminal window without any bar. This way you will see what the polybar sees
and you will understand how the updates work and what is printed.

You can call the script with the following arguments:

- ### `tail <STANDBY_LABEL> <SECONDS>`
  This is the command which you want to put in your polybar `exec` field.
  It runs an infinite loop that calls the [`update`](#update-pid) routine every `SECONDS` seconds.
  We will call the process which runs this `tail` routine the *tail process*.

- ### `update <PID>`
  This routine is executed automatically inside the tail process every few seconds.
  However, you will most probably want to call it inside the tail process
  also manually (i.e. in addition to the regular updates) after you have
  just executed some of the commands below. For example, if you have
  created a timer with [`new`](#new-minutes-timer_label-action), you want to call [`update`](#update-pid) on the tail process right after. `PID` needs to be the pid of the tail process.
  (this is [provided by polybar with `%pid%`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Module:-script#examples))<br>
  The following action is executed in the tail process
  every few seconds and whenever you call 'update' with the pid of the tail process:
  1. If there is a timer running and its expiry time is <= now then it executes `ACTION` and kills the timer.
  2. It prints the current output. This is either `<TIMER_LABEL><minutes left>` if there is a timer running or `<STANDBY_LABEL>` if no timer is running.

These were the basis commands to handle the technical side. Now with the
following commands you can control the timer. If you want the bar to
to update immediately after a change, you should call [`update`](#update-pid) right after!
Example:<br>
`polybar.sh increase 60 ; polybar.sh update <pid of tail process>'`

- ### `new <MINUTES> <TIMER_LABEL> [ACTION=""]`
  1. If there is a timer already running it gets killed.
  2. Creates a timer of length `MINUTES` minutes and `TIMER_LABEL` as its
  label and sets its action to `ACTION`.

- ### `increase <SECONDS>`
  If there is no timer running, nothing happens and it exits with 1.
  If there is a timer running, it is extended by `SECONDS` seconds. This
  can also be negative and the the timer gets shortened. Then it exits
  with 0.

- ### `cancel`
  If there is a timer running it gets canceled. The `ACTION` will not get
  executed.

## Tips & Tricks

When there is no timer active then [`increase`](#increase-seconds) does nothing. The following command
increases the existing timer if it's active and creates a timer with label
"mytimer" of lengths 1 minute if there is no timer currently running:
```
polybar-timer.sh increase 60 || polybar-timer.sh new 1 'mytimer' 'notify-send "Timer expired."'
```
So now e.g. scrolling up also does something when there is no timer active - it starts a new timer!
